    Chiplets are emerging as novel solutions for high-performance AI computing processors. Vertical interconnects (VICs) including µbumps, C4 bumps and through-silicon vias (TSVs) in chiplets are critical as they not only carry signals and power supplies but also transfer heat efficiently. Due to need of fine-grained VIC modeling, existing thermal tools are ineffective for VIC-embedded chiplets. Moreover, electrothermal analysis in previous architectural simulators do not consider temperature dependence for short-circuit power, which is nontrivial in our experiments. To address the above problems, this paper proposes SYSgen, a framework for accurate, location-based temperature-dependent power profiling and VIC planning for integrated chiplets. SYSgen achieves a 97.77× speedup with a maximum error below 1.2°C when the chiplet temperature is around 100°C compared to COMSOL. It also reduces VIC number by 21.7% and 12.4% compared to two existing papers with same constraints on signal and power routing and maximum temperature.
