I am an incoming PhD student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> (PolyU), with research interests in computer architecture and the intersection between software and hardware systems.

Prior to starting my PhD journey, I received a BSc in Computer Science with First Class Honours from the <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/">University of Nottingham Ningbo China</a> (UNNC), where I was also honored as an Outstanding Graduate. During my third undergraduate year, I participated in an exchange program at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a>, UK.
